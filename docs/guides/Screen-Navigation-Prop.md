# Screen Navigation Prop

Each screen in your app will recieve a navigation prop, which contains the following:


## `navigate` - Link to other screens

Call this to link to another screen in your app. Takes the following arguments:

- `routeName` - A destination routeName that has been registered somewhere in the app's router
- `params` - Params to merge into the destination route
- `action` - (advanced) The sub-action to run in the child router, if the screen is a navigator.

```js
class HomeScreen extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const {navigate} = this.props.navigation;

    return (
      <View>
        <Text>This is the home screen of the app</Text>
        <Button
          onPress={() => navigate('Profile', {name: 'Brent'})}
          title="Go to Brent's profile"
        />
      </View>
     )
   }
}
```

## `state` - The screen's current state/route

A screen has access to it's route via `this.props.navigation.state`. Each will contain:

- `routeName` - the name of the route config in the router
- `key` - a unique identifier used to sort routes
- `params` - an optional object of string options for this screen

```js
class ProfileScreen extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const {state} = this.props.navigation;
    // state.routeName === 'Profile'
    return (
      <Text>Name: {state.params.name}</Text>
    );
  }
}
```


## `setParams` - Make changes to route params

Firing the `setParams` action allows a screen to change the params in the route, which is useful for updating the header buttons and title.

```js
class ProfileScreen extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const {setParams} = this.props.navigation;
    return (
      <Button
        onPress={() => setParams({name: 'Lucy'})}
        title="Set title name to 'Lucy'"
      />
     )
   }
}
```

## `goBack` - Close the active screen and move back

```js
class HomeScreen extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const {goBack} = this.props.navigation;
    return (
      <View>
        <Button
          onPress={() => goBack()}
          title="Go back from this HomeScreen"
        />
        <Button
          onPress={() => goBack(null)}
          title="Go back anywhere"
        />
        <Button
          onPress={() => goBack('screen-123')}
          title="Go back from screen-123"
        />
      </View>
     )
   }
}
```

Optionally provide a key, which specifies the route to go back from. By default, goBack will close the route that it is called from. If the goal is to go back *anywhere*, without specifying what is getting closed, call `.goBack(null);`


## `dispatch` - Send an action to the router

Use dispatch to send any navigation action to the router. The other navigation functions use dispatch behind the scenes.

The following actions are supported:

### Navigate
```js
{
  type: 'Navigate',
  routeName: 'Profile',
  params: {},

  // navigate can have a nested navigate action that will be run inside the child router
  action: {type: 'Navigate', routeName: 'SubProfileRoute'}
}
```


### Reset

The `Reset` action wipes the whole navigation state and replaces it with the result of several actions.

```js
{
  type: 'Reset',
  actions: ,
}
```

### SetParams

When dispatching `SetParams`, the router will produce a new state that has changed the params of a particular route, as identified by the key

```js
{
  type: 'SetParams',
  params: {}, // these are the new params that will be merged into the existing route params
  // The key of the route that should get the new params
  key: 'screen-123',
}
```
