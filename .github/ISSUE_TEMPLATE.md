## Before You Start...
The issue list is reserved exclusively for bug reports and feature requests. That means we do not accept usage questions.

For usage questions, please use the following resources:

- [Read the docs](https://reactnavigation.org/)
- [Ask on the Reactiflux (#react-navigation)](https://discord.gg/reactiflux)
- [Look for / ask questions on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/react-navigation)
- Also try to search for your issue - it may have already been answered or even fixed in the development branch. However, if you find that an old, closed issue still persists in the latest version, you should open a new issue.
