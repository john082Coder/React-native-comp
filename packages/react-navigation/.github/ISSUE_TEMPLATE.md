## The issue list is reserved for bugs and feature requests, not for questions.

For usage questions, try to:

- [Read the docs](https://reactnavigation.org/)
- [Ask on the Reactiflux (#react-navigation)](https://discord.gg/reactiflux)
- [Look for / ask questions on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/react-navigation)
- Search for your issue - it may have already been answered or even fixed in the development branch. However, if you find that an old, closed issue still persists in the latest version, you should open a new issue.
